# Aldo-Ibuado-Portfolio

## Description

Studying to be a full-stack web developer has pushed me to realize how imporant it is to have a portfolio to showcase my work. I would like to show potential employers the projects I have worked on/made. Employers will want to see the projects I have worked on and having this website is a way for me to show them. I learned how to write code from scratch, but still does require improvement.
